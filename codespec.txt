I put this spec here so I can write as it tells, this is the basic rule this
repo must follow.

### code style
- Folder name shold be written in lower-case letters instead of capitals.
- File name also in lower-case.
- Class, method, and field names donnot use camel casing.
- Sample:

```
sample.lua:

function sample:do_fun()
end
```

### debug and log
- use core.debug as more as possible.
- set debug level to a value when init the process with code.debuglevel(level, [ignore the output without level,set -1 will ignore]).
- debug level 0 is used by engine.
